**Educational/Interpretive Application**

**Introduction**

The goal of this project is to produce a set of applications that are generally
educational or interpretive in nature.  The target platform for most of these will
generally be mobile devices. 

**Projects**

 * Ira Cards <http://www.iracards.co.nz>, an application intended to present
   users with words in Te Reo upon which they can reflect and then use the 
   app to find more information about the word.

 * SpringIn2It, an app to help groups working on a team health and fitness
   challenge. A goal of this particular app is to focus on Maori and 
   Pasifika groups.

 * A geo-capable interpretive app for the Dunedin Botanic Garden. A similar
   app may also be built for the DCC for use on walking tracks in Dunedin

 * A data visualisation application that allows users to generate
   animated maps displaying time series data, e.g., occurences of 
   earthquakes.
