**BIT Platform Project**

**Overview**

The goal of this project is to deliver a set of online services for use in the BIT
as well as other programmes.

**Background**

In the past few years we have experimented with a number of online tools and
have identified some that have proven useful in the delivery of the BIT programme.
At this point we would like to bring a number of these together under to form a 
unified platform that will make these services easier for students and staff to use.

Some of this project will involve integrating and adapting exisiting open source 
projects along with the development of some new software. This project will also 
involve deploying and organising things to create a maintainable platform.

Likely components of this project include:

 * Revision control platform (GitLab or GitBucket)
 * Messaging (Mattermost)
 * Inventory control/checkout (Merci)
 * Course materials hosting 
 * A Parson's Puzzle tool
 * Issue tracking
 * A calendar
