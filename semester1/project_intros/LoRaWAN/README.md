**LoRaWAN**

**Introduction**

LoRaWAN (*Long Range Wide Area Network*) is a low power, long range, wireless 
networking protocol for Internet of Things devices. The goal of this project 
is to deploy a LoRa network in Dunedin, including one or more network 
gateways, necessary back end servers, and one or more sample IoT applications.

**Background**

This project team will contribute to The Things Network <http://thethingsnetwork.org> 
a global open source project to build and deploy an international LoRaWAN.
Project work in Dunedin will involve:

 * Deploying one or more gateway devices;
 * Writing code for and testing TTN *routers* and *handlers*;
 * Building example LoRa capable devices;
 * Building applications that use those devices.
