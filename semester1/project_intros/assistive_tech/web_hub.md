**Web hub repository for low-cost accessibility software and assistive
technologies solutions**

**Overview**

This project has the end goal of creating a web hub repository of
low-cost accessibility and assistive technologies solutions for computer
users with motor impairments.

**Background**

Users with motor disability are often unable or severely handicapped to
input text in a computer. While some accessibility software and
assistive technology solutions exist for users with motor disabilities,
often such systems are expensive unaffordable for a significant number
of potential users. This project would create the infrastructure for
online hosting of accessibility software and documentation of low-cost
assistive technologies. These online hub would host accessibility
related final year projects from the BIT program at Otago Polytechnic.

**Deliverables**

-   Web hub repository of accessibility software and assistive
    technology solutions for people with motor impairment

-   search engine optimized so potential users can find the software
    they require
