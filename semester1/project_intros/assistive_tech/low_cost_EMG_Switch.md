**Low cost wireless DIY EMG switch**

**Overview**

This project has the end goal of making a low-cost wireless EMG switch.

**Background**

Users with motor disability are often unable or severely handicapped to
use their hands to interact with a tablet device. While some
accessibility solutions exist for motor disabilities in Windows
environments, some of them are extremely expensive due to the inability
of industry to employ economies of scale to a relatively small niche
market. This project involves researching for low cost hardware options
for building and electromyographic (EMG) switch. In this context, a
switch refers to an on/off sort of button. An EMG switch can detect
intentional muscle movement/twitching and such muscle activations can be
used as an input device to control a computer. The envisioned switch
should communicate wirelessly with a computer and serve as an
accessibility solution.

**Deliverables**

-   Research for the optimal hardware equipment combination for building
    a low-cost EMG switch

-   maybe 3-D printing the carcase for aesthetics and protective
    purposes

-   assemble the actual EMG switch from purchased components

-   create a GUI that allows a user to map a muscle twitch (as detected
    by the hardware device) and map it to a specific user interface
    command (left click, right-click, scape, etc.)

-   Write comprehensive and comprehensible documentation so a layman can
    reproduce the construction of the hardware device at home on its own

Note

Such a device already exists, see the picture, but is not in production
anymore. However, it used to cost over \$3000. The goal of this project
should be to build something whose components cost much less (hopefully
under 100\$)
