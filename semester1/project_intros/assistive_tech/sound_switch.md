**Sound switch**

**Overview**

This project has the end goal of making a low-cost sound switch.

**Background**

Users with motor disability are often unable or severely handicapped to
use their hands to interact with a tablet device. While some
accessibility solutions exist for motor disabilities in Windows
environments, some of them are extremely expensive due to the inability
of industry to employ economies of scale to a relatively small niche
market. This project involves creating a low-cost on/off switch operated
with tongue snaps (not sure if this is the right word). The envisioned
switch should provide a degree of freedom to enhance assistive
technologies such as gaze interaction for computer control.

**Deliverables**

-   module that monitors a microphone and detects tongue snaps

-   GUI that allows a user to map a tongue snap (as detected by the
    previous module) and map it to a specific user interface command
    (left click, right-click, key, etc.)
