**Low cost rehabilitation platform for stroke patients**

**Overview**

This project has the end goal of creating a low-cost rehabilitation
platform for patients affected with stroke

**Background**

A stroke is a sudden interruption of blood flow to parts of the brain
causing it to stop working and eventually damaging brain cells. One of
the outcomes stroke patients may experience might be upper extremity
motor disability. Recently it has been shown that extensive
physiotherapy can aid in the recovery of function for stroke patients.
Extensive physiotherapy in this context refers to several hours of
repetitive exercise motions of the affected limb per day with the
assistant of a physiotherapist. However, it is economically unfeasible
to provide a physiotherapist 24/7 for all patients who have suffered a
stroke. This project intends to build and automated rehabilitation
platform to exercise the upper limb for patients with motor impairment.

So the idea of this project would be to create a low-cost alternative to
this device:

**Deliverables**

-   table with low cost mechanism (for instance a toy car kind of
    device) that allows 2D movement of the upper limb to a given
    coordinate position on the table plane

-   gaze selection of targets to direct arm movement
