**Accessibility interface for Oculus Rift**

**Overview**

This project has the end goal of creating an accessibility interface for
the Oculus Rift

**Background**

Users with motor disability are often unable or severely handicapped to
use their hands to interact with electronic devices. Emergent hot
devices such as Oculus Rift lack accessibility options for users with
motor impairment. This project involves the creation of a software layer
that permits the control of Oculus Rift

for users with motor impairment by using gaze tracking. This project
will use gaze tracking hardware developed specifically for the Oculus
Rift by the following Danish company.
