**Low-cost brain computer interface Switch**

**Overview**

This project has the end goal of creating a low-cost brain computer
interface Switch that is able to detect imagining hand movements and
translate them into an on/off signal.

**Background**

Users with motor disability are often unable or severely handicapped to
input commands in a computer. While some accessibility software and
assistive technology solutions exist for users with motor disabilities,
often such systems are expensive unaffordable for a significant number
of potential users. Being able to bridge the gap between the user and
the physical computer through the usage of brain computer interfaces
that are able to detect “thoughts” is very appealing. Obviously, there
are several technical hurdles to make such a vision a reality. However,
people are trying. The OpenBCI project has created a low-cost EEG
hardware system that is able to read brain signals with a hardware
device that costs less than \$200.

This project would attempt to transform some of those signals into an on
off switch for computer control purposes. Obviously the detection of
mental patterns in EEG signals is extremely complicated. However, this
work has already been done for you.

So this project would not be about actually detecting and classifying
the signals but rather about learning how to use the hardware and
building a driver so the OpenBCI hardware can communicate with the
BCIlab software which is able to classify the brain signals.

**Deliverables**

-   a software layer that is able to bridge the gap between the OpenBCI
    hardware and the BCI lab software for analysis of brain signals.

-   A simple on/off switch that is able to discriminate imaginary hand
    movements from a control (rest condition)

**Note of caution**

This project will require a certain amount of technical expertise and
motivation to learn about exotic and cutting edge technologies.
